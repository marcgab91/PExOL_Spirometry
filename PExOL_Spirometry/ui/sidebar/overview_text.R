       and time-dependent <b>animation</b> of spirometric data.<br></p>
       <p>The aim is to provide animated diagrams of the basic spirometric parameters
       <b>time</b>, <b>volume</b> and <b>flow</b> for <b>biofeedback</b> applications.</p>
       <p> By following the linear pattern of the tabs, spirometric data can be visualized and manipulated
       and animated diagrams can be created.</p>
       <p>The tab <b>User data</b> allows the upload of a dataset with multiple trials
       or the selection of predefined samples.</p>
       <p>In the tab <b>Reference data</b> the selected trials
       can be displayed in the context of statistical datasets.</p>
       <p>The tab <b>Manipulation</b> allows the customization of the parameters
       time, volume and flow of an existing trial.</p>
       <p>In <b>Animation</b>, the previously created diagram can be rendered into an animation.</p>
       <p>The manipulated trial and the generated static and animated plots can be saved under the tab <b>Download</b>.</p>")
